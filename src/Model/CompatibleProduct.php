     * This container consists of an array of motor vehicles that are compatible with
     * the motor vehicle part or accessory specified by the SKU value in the call URI.
     * Each motor vehicle is defined through a separate set of name/value pairs. In the
     * <strong>name</strong> field, the vehicle aspect (such as 'make', 'model',
     * 'year', 'trim', or 'engine') will be identified, and the <strong>value</strong>
     * field will be used to identify the value of each aspect. The <a
     * href="/api-docs/commerce/taxonomy/resources/category_tree/methods/getCompatibilityProperties">getCompatibilityProperties</a>
     * method of the Taxonomy API can be used to retrieve applicable vehicle aspect
     * names for a specified category, and the <a
     * href="/api-docs/commerce/taxonomy/resources/category_tree/methods/getCompatibilityPropertyValues">getCompatibilityPropertyValues</a>
     * method of the Taxonomy API can be used to retrieve possible values for these
     * same vehicle aspect names. Below is an example of identifying one motor vehicle
     * using the <strong>compatibilityProperties</strong>
     * container:<br><br><code>&quot;compatibilityProperties&quot; :
